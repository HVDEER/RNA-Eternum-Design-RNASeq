# RNA Eternum 

A hybrid AI + RNA-Seq pipeline inspired by the Eterna game to optimize synthetic RNA design and evaluate its real-world expression.

## Concept
RNA Eternum combines Eterna's community-optimized RNA structures with RNA-Seq expression data to explore how folding impacts transcriptional stability and efficiency.

## Features
- Select RNA gene targets from viral/synthetic studies
- Redesign structures using Eterna + Python scripting
- Analyze RNA-Seq data (read alignment, expression quant)
- Compare expression, GC content, Î”G, and structure metrics

## Extensions
- Train a model to predict expression based on structure
- Publish insights for mRNA vaccine or gene therapy design

## Tech Stack
- Python (Biopython, ViennaRNA, pandas)
- Eterna puzzle input + optimization
- RNA-Seq analysis: Salmon, STAR, DESeq2 (via R or CLI)
- seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly for visualizations
